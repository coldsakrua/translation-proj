From these two dimensions—human vs. rational

four. The methods used are necessarily different: the pursuit of human-like intelligence must be in part an empirical science related to psychology, involving observations and hypotheses about actual human behavior and thought processes; a rationalist approach, on the other hand, involves a combination of mathematics and engineering, and connects to statistics, control theory, and economics.

Acting humanly: The Turing test approach
The
Turing test
, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed as a thought experiment that would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question “Can a machine think?” A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.",前：chap1_para9 | 后：chap1_para11,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"turing,test,question",Alan Turing,,

•
natural language processing
to communicate successfully in a human language;
•
knowledge representation
to store what it knows or hears;
•
automated reasoning

simulation of a person as unnecessary to demonstrate intelligence. However, other researchers have proposed a

computer vision

•
robotics
to manipulate objects and move about.",前：chap1_para11 | 后：chap1_para13,AI_Popular,Semi_Formal_Academic,"turing,total,test",Turing,,
chap1_para13,1,"These six disciplines compose most of AI. Yet AI researchers have devoted little effort to passing the Turing test, believing that it is more important to study the underlying principles of intelligence. The quest for “artificial flight” succeeded when engineers and inventors stopped imitating birds and started using wind tunnels and learning about aerodynamics. Aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making “machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool even other pigeons.”
1.1.2
Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach
To say that a program thinks like a human, we must know how humans think. We can learn about human thought in three ways:
•
introspection
—trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by;
•
psychological experiments
—observing a person in action;
•
brain imaging
—observing the brain in action.",前：chap1_para12 | 后：chap1_para14,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"human,think,thought","AI,Turing,Aeronautical",,
chap1_para14,1,"Once we have a sufficiently precise theory of the mind, it becomes possible to express the theory as a computer program. If the program’s input–output behavior matches corresponding human behavior, that is evidence that some of the program’s mechanisms could also be operating in humans.",前：chap1_para13 | 后：chap1_para15,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"program,theory,behavior",无,,
chap1_para15,1,"For example, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, who developed GPS, the “General Problem Solver” (Newell and Simon, 1961), were not content merely to have their program solve
problems correctly. They were more concerned with comparing the sequence and timing of its reasoning steps to those of human subjects solving the same problems. The interdisciplinary field of
cognitive science
brings together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to construct precise and testable theories of the human mind.",前：chap1_para14 | 后：chap1_para16,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"problem,simon,human","Allen Newell,Herbert Simon,Newell,Simon,AI",,
chap1_para16,1,"Cognitive science is a fascinating field in itself, worthy of several textbooks and at least one encyclopedia (Wilson and Keil, 1999).

Real cognitive science, however, is necessarily based on experimental investigation of actual humans or animals.

chap1_para17,1,"In the early days of AI there was often confusion between the approaches. An author would argue that an algorithm performs well on a task and that it is
therefore
a good model of human performance, or vice versa. Modern authors separate the two kinds of claims; this distinction has allowed both AI and cognitive science to develop more rapidly. The two fields fertilize each other, most notably in computer vision, which incorporates neurophysiological evidence into computational models. Recently, the combination of neuroimaging methods combined with machine learning techniques for analyzing such data has led to the beginnings of a capability to “read minds”—that is, to ascertain the semantic content of a person’s inner thoughts. This capability could, in turn, shed further light on how human cognition works.",前：chap1_para16 | 后：chap1_para18,AI_Popular,Semi_Formal_Academic,"author,model,human","AI,AI",,
chap1_para18,1,"1.1.3
Thinking rationally: The “laws of thought” approach
The Greek philosopher Aristotle was one of the first to attempt to codify “right thinking”—that is, irrefutable reasoning processes. His
syllogisms
provided patterns for argument structures that always yielded correct conclusions when given correct premises. The canonical example starts with
Socrates is a man
and
all men are mortal
and concludes that
Socrates is mortal.",前：chap1_para17 | 后：chap1_para19,AI_Popular,Semi_Formal_Academic,"thinking,correct,socrates","Aristotle,Socrates,Socrates",,

probability
fills this gap, allowing rigorous reasoning with uncertain information. In principle, it allows the construction of a comprehensive model of rational thought, leading from raw perceptual information to an understanding of how the world works to predictions about the future. What it does not do, is generate intelligent
behavior.",前：chap1_para21 | 后：chap1_para23,AI_Popular,Semi_Formal_Academic,"world,know,rule",无,,

chap1_para24,1,"1.1.4
Acting rationally: The rational agent approach
An
agent
is just something that acts (
agent
comes from the Latin
agere,
to do). Of course, all computer programs do something, but computer agents are expected to do more: operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to
change, and create and pursue goals. A
rational agent
is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.",前：chap1_para23 | 后：chap1_para25,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"agent,rational,something",无,,
chap1_para25,1,"In the “laws of thought” approach to AI, the emphasis was on correct inferences. Making correct inferences is sometimes
part
of being a rational agent, because one way to act rationally is to deduce that a given action is best and then to act on that conclusion. On the other hand, there are ways of acting rationally that cannot be said to involve inference. For example, recoiling from a hot stove is a reflex action that is usually more successful than a slower action taken after careful deliberation.",前：chap1_para24 | 后：chap1_para26,AI_Popular,Semi_Formal_Academic,"inference,action,correct",AI,,
chap1_para26,1,"All the skills needed for the Turing test also allow an agent to act rationally. Knowledge representation and reasoning enable agents to reach good decisions. We need to be able to generate comprehensible sentences in natural language to get by in a complex society. We need learning not only for erudition, but also because it improves our ability to generate effective behavior, especially in circumstances that are new.",前：chap1_para25 | 后：chap1_para27,AI_Popular,Semi_Formal_Academic,"agent,need,generate",Turing,,
chap1_para27,1,"The rational-agent approach to AI has two advantages over the other approaches. First, it is more general than the “laws of thought” approach because correct inference is just one of several possible mechanisms for achieving rationality. Second, it is more amenable to scientific development. The standard of rationality is mathematically well defined and completely general. We can often work back from this specification to derive agent designs that provably achieve it—something that is largely impossible if the goal is to imitate human behavior or thought processes.",前：chap1_para26 | 后：chap1_para28,AI_Popular,Semi_Formal_Academic,"approach,general,thought",AI,,
chap1_para28,1,"For these reasons, the rational-agent approach to AI has prevailed throughout most of the field’s history. In the early decades, rational agents were built on logical foundations and formed definite plans to achieve specific goals. Later, methods based on probability theory and machine learning allowed the creation of agents that could make decisions under uncertainty to attain the best expected outcome. In a nutshell,
AI has focused on the study and construction of agents that

chap1_para29,1,"What counts as the right thing is defined by the objective that we provide to the agent. This general paradigm is so pervasive that we might call it the
standard model

It prevails not only in AI, but also in control theory, where a controller minimizes a cost function; in operations research, where a policy maximizes a sum of rewards; in statistics, where a decision rule minimizes a loss function; and in economics, where a decision maker maximizes utility or some measure of social welfare.",前：chap1_para28 | 后：chap1_para30,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"minimizes,function,maximizes",AI,,

Beneficial machines
The standard model has been a useful guide for AI research since its inception, but it is probably not the right model in the long run. The reason is that the standard model assumes that we will supply a fully specified objective to the machine.",前：chap1_para31 | 后：chap1_para33,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"model,machine,standard",AI,,
chap1_para33,1,"For an artificially defined task such as chess or shortest-path computation, the task comes with an objective built in—so the standard model is applicable. As we move into the real world, however, it becomes more and more difficult to specify the objective completely and
correctly. For example, in designing a self-driving car, one might think that the objective is to reach the destination safely. But driving along any road incurs a risk of injury due to other errant drivers, equipment failure, and so on; thus, a strict goal of safety requires staying in the garage. There is a tradeoff between making progress towards the destination and incurring a risk of injury. How should this tradeoff be made? Furthermore, to what extent can we allow the car to take actions that would annoy other drivers? How much should the car moderate its acceleration, steering, and braking to avoid shaking up the passenger? These kinds of questions are difficult to answer a priori. They are particularly problematic in the general area of human–robot interaction, of which the self-driving car is one example.",前：chap1_para32 | 后：chap1_para34,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"car,objective,task",无,,

If we are developing an AI system in the lab or in a simulator—as has been the case for most of the field’s history—there is an easy fix for an incorrectly specified objective: reset the system, fix the objective, and try again. As the field progresses towards increasingly capable intelligent systems that are deployed in the real world, this approach is no longer viable. A system deployed with an incorrect objective will have negative consequences. Moreover, the more intelligent the system, the more negative the consequences.",前：chap1_para33 | 后：chap1_para35,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"objective,system,problem",AI,,

their
objectives; we want them to pursue
our
objectives. If we cannot transfer those objectives perfectly to the machine, then we need a new formulation—one in which the machine is pursuing our objectives, but is necessarily
uncertain
as to what they are. When a machine knows that it doesn’t know the complete objective, it has an incentive to act cautiously, to ask permission, to learn more about our preferences through observation, and to defer to human control. Ultimately, we want agents that are
provably beneficial

Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) built the Pascaline in 1642 and wrote that it “produces effects which appear nearer to thought than all the actions of animals.” Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) built a mechanical device intended to carry out operations on concepts rather than numbers, but its scope was rather limited. In his 1651 book
Leviathan,
Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) suggested the idea of a thinking machine, an “artificial animal” in his words, arguing “For what is the heart but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many wheels.” He also suggested that reasoning was like numerical computation: “For ‘reason’ ... is nothing but ‘reckoning,’ that is adding and subtracting.”
It’s one thing to say that the mind operates, at least in part, according to logical or numerical rules, and to build physical systems that emulate some of those rules. It’s another to say that the mind itself
is
such a physical system. René Descartes (1596–1650) gave the first clear discussion of the distinction between mind and matter. He noted that a purely physical conception of the mind seems to leave little room for free will. If the mind is governed entirely by physical laws, then it has no more free will than a rock “deciding” to fall downward. Descartes was a proponent of
dualism

The inception of artificial intelligence (1943–1956)
The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was done by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943). Inspired by the mathematical modeling work of Pitts’s advisor Nicolas Rashevsky (1936, 1938), they drew on three sources: knowledge of the basic physiology and function of neurons in the brain; a formal analysis of propositional logic due to Russell and Whitehead; and Turing’s theory of computation. They proposed a model of artificial neurons in which each neuron is characterized as being “on” or “off,” with a switch to “on” occurring in response to stimulation by a sufficient number of neighboring neurons. The state of a neuron was conceived of as “factually equivalent to a proposition which proposed its adequate stimulus.” They showed, for example, that any computable function could be computed by some network of connected neurons, and that all the logical connectives (
AND
,
OR
,
NOT
, etc.) could be implemented by simple network structures. McCulloch and Pitts also suggested that suitably defined networks could learn. Donald Hebb (1949) demonstrated a simple updating rule for modifying the connection strengths between neurons. His rule, now called
Hebbian learning
, remains an influential model to this day.",前：chap1_para126 | 后：chap1_para128,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"neuron,pitt,network","AI,Warren McCulloch,Walter Pitts,Pitts’s,Nicolas Rashevsky,Russell,Whitehead,Turing,Pitts,Donald Hebb",,

Later, at Princeton, Minsky studied universal computation in neural networks. His Ph.D. committee was skeptical about whether this kind of work should be considered mathematics, but von Neumann reportedly said, “If it isn’t now, it will be someday.”
There were a number of other examples of early work that can be characterized as AI, including two checkers-playing programs developed independently in 1952 by Christopher Strachey at the University of Manchester and by Arthur Samuel at IBM. However, Alan Turing’s vision was the most influential. He gave lectures on the topic as early as 1947 at the London Mathematical Society and articulated a persuasive agenda in his 1950 article “Computing
Machinery and Intelligence.” Therein, he introduced the Turing test, machine learning, genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning. He dealt with many of the objections raised to the possibility of AI, as described in
Chapter 28
. He also suggested that it would be easier to create human-level AI by developing learning algorithms and then teaching the machine rather than by programming its intelligence by hand.

Thus, GPS was probably the first program to embody the “thinking humanly” approach. The success of GPS and subsequent programs as models of cognition led Newell and Simon (1976) to formulate the famous
physical symbol system
hypothesis, which states that “a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action.” What they meant is that any system (human or machine) exhibiting intelligence must operate by manipulating data structures composed of symbols.

From the beginning, AI researchers were not shy about making predictions of their coming successes. The following statement by Herbert Simon in 1957 is often quoted:
It is not my aim to surprise or shock you—but the simplest way I can summarize is to say that there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and that create.

A third difficulty arose because of some fundamental limitations on the basic structures being used to generate intelligent behavior. For example, Minsky and Papert’s book
Perceptrons
(1969) proved that, although perceptrons (a simple form of neural network) could be shown to learn anything they were capable of representing, they could represent very little. In particular, a two-input perceptron could not be trained to recognize when its two inputs were different. Although their results did not apply to more complex, multilayer networks, research funding for neural-net research soon dwindled to almost nothing. Ironically, the new back-propagation learning algorithms that were to cause an enormous resurgence in neural-net research in the late 1980s and again in the 2010s had already been developed in other contexts in the early 1960s (Kelley, 1960; Bryson, 1962).",前：chap1_para147 | 后：chap1_para149,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"research,lighthill,different","AI,Lighthill,AI,Minsky,Papert,multilayer networks,Kelley,Bryson",,

The picture of problem solving that had arisen during the first decade of AI research was of a general-purpose search mechanism trying to string together elementary reasoning steps to find complete solutions. Such approaches have been called
weak methods
because, although general, they do not scale up to large or difficult problem instances.

(HMMs) came to dominate the area. Two aspects of HMMs are relevant. First, they are based on a rigorous mathematical theory. This allowed speech researchers to build on several decades of mathematical results developed in other fields. Second, they are generated by a process of training on a large corpus of real speech data. This ensures that the performance is robust, and in rigorous blind tests HMMs improved their scores steadily. As a result, speech technology and the related field of handwritten character recognition made the transition to widespread industrial and consumer applications. Note that there was no scientific claim that humans use HMMs to recognize speech; rather, HMMs provided a mathematical framework for understanding and solving the problem. We will see in

If we have access to substantially greater machine intelligence, the ceiling on our ambitions is raised substantially. The potential for AI and robotics to free humanity from menial repetitive work and to dramatically increase the production of goods and services could presage an era of peace and plenty. The capacity to accelerate scientific research could result in cures for disease and solutions for climate change and resource shortages. As Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, has suggested: “First solve AI, then use AI to solve everything else.”
Long before we have an opportunity to “solve AI,” however, we will incur risks from the misuse of AI, inadvertent or otherwise. Some of these are already apparent, while others seem likely based on current trends:
•
Lethal autonomous weapons:
These are defined by the United Nations as weapons that can locate, select, and eliminate human targets without human intervention. A primary concern with such weapons is their
scalability:
the absence of a requirement for human supervision means that a small group can deploy an arbitrarily large number of weapons against human targets defined by any feasible recognition criterion. The technologies needed for autonomous weapons are similar to those needed for self-driving cars. Informal expert discussions on the potential risks of lethal autonomous weapons began at the UN in 2014, moving to the formal pre-treaty stage of a Group of Governmental Experts in 2017.",前：chap1_para215 | 后：chap1_para217,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"weapon,human,solve","AI,Demis Hassabis,Google DeepMind,AI,AI,AI,AI,the United Nations,UN,Group of Governmental Experts",,

Impact on employment:
Concerns about machines eliminating jobs are centuries old. The story is never simple: machines do some of the tasks that humans might otherwise do, but they also make humans more productive and therefore more employable, and make companies more profitable and therefore able to pay higher wages. They may render some activities economically viable that would otherwise be impractical. Their
use generally results in increasing wealth but tends to have the effect of shifting wealth from labor to capital, further exacerbating increases in inequality. Previous advances in technology—such as the invention of mechanical looms—have resulted in serious disruptions to employment, but eventually people find new kinds of work to do. On the other hand, it is possible that AI will be doing those new kinds of work too.

Nils Nilsson (1995), one of the original leaders of the Shakey project at SRI, reminded the field of those broader goals and warned that the subfields were in danger of becoming ends in themselves. Later, some influential founders of AI, including John McCarthy (2007), Marvin Minsky (2007), and Patrick Winston (Beal and Winston, 2009), concurred with Nilsson’s warnings, suggesting that instead of focusing on measurable performance in specific applications, AI should return to its roots of striving for, in Herb Simon’s words, “machines that think, that learn and that create.” They called the effort

A robotic agent might have cameras and infrared range finders for sensors and various motors for actuators. A software agent receives file contents, network packets, and human input (keyboard/mouse/touchscreen/voice) as sensory inputs and acts on the environment by writing files, sending network packets, and displaying information or generating sounds.

We might propose to measure performance by the amount of dirt cleaned up in a single eight-hour shift. With a rational agent, of course, what you ask for is what you get. A rational agent can maximize this performance measure by cleaning up the dirt, then dumping it all on the floor, then cleaning it up again, and so on.

Which is preferable might seem to be a fine point of janitorial science, but in fact it is a deep philosophical question with far-reaching implications.

outcome of its actions and can act accordingly; but omniscience is impossible in reality. Consider the following example: I am walking along the Champs Elysées one day and I see an old friend across the street. There is no traffic nearby and I’m
not otherwise engaged, so, being rational, I start to cross the street. Meanwhile, at 33,000 feet, a cargo door falls off a passing airliner,

Goals just provide a crude binary distinction between “happy” and “unhappy” states.

way to be rational—we have already seen a rational agent program for the vacuum world (

Furthermore, in two kinds of cases, goals are inadequate but a utility-based agent can still make rational decisions. First, when there are conflicting goals, only some of which can be achieved (for example, speed and safety), the utility function specifies the appropriate tradeoff.

aim for, none of which can be achieved with certainty, utility provides a way in which the likelihood of success can be weighed against the importance of the goals.",前：chap2_para146 | 后：chap2_para148,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"agent,goal,utility",无,,

Appendix A
defines expectation more precisely.) In
Chapter 15
, we show that any rational agent must behave
as if
it possesses a utility function whose expected value it tries to maximize. An agent that possesses an
explicit
utility function can make rational decisions with a general-purpose algorithm that does not depend on the specific utility function being maximized.

Perhaps surprisingly, AI has concentrated for most of its history on isolated components of agents—question-answering systems, theorem-provers, vision systems, and so on—rather than on whole agents. The discussion of agents in the text by Genesereth and Nilsson (1987) was an influential exception.

Chapter 15

Problem-Solving Agents
Imagine an agent enjoying a touring vacation in Romania. The agent wants to take in the sights, improve its Romanian, enjoy the nightlife, avoid hangovers, and so on. The decision problem is a complex one. Now, suppose the agent is currently in the city of Arad and has a nonrefundable ticket to fly out of Bucharest the following day. The agent observes street signs and sees that there are three roads leading out of Arad: one toward Sibiu, one to Timisoara, and one to Zerind. None of these are the goal, so unless the agent is familiar with the geography of Romania, it will not know which road to follow.",前：chap3_para6 | 后：chap3_para8,AI_Popular,Semi_Formal_Academic,"agent,romania,arad","Problem-Solving Agents,Romania,Arad,Arad,Sibiu,Timisoara,Zerind,Romania",,

open-loop

the agent can pick up, push, or otherwise act upon; a wall or other impassible obstacle in a cell prevents an agent from moving into that cell. The

States:
A state of the world says which objects are in which cells. For the vacuum world, the objects are the agent and any dirt. In the simple two-cell version, the agent can be in either of the two cells, and each cell can either contain dirt or not, so there are 2 · 2 · 2 = 8 states (see

Real-world problems
We have already seen how the

is defined in terms of specified locations and transitions along edges between them. Route-finding algorithms are used in a variety of applications. Some, such as Web sites and in-car systems that provide driving directions, are relatively straightforward extensions of the Romania example. (The main complications are varying costs due to traffic-dependent delays, and rerouting due to road closures.) Others, such as routing video streams in computer networks, military operations planning, and airline travel-planning systems, involve much more complex specifications. Consider the airline travel problems that must be solved by a travel-planning Web site:
•
States:
Each state obviously includes a location (e.g., an airport) and the current time.

of complex objects (such as electric motors) by a robot has been standard industry practice since the 1970s. Algorithms first find a feasible assembly sequence and then work to optimize the process.

In assembly problems, the aim is to find an order in which to assemble the parts of some object. If the wrong order is chosen, there will be no way to add some part later in the sequence without undoing some of the work already done. Checking an action in the sequence for feasibility is a difficult geometrical search problem closely related to robot navigation. Thus, the generation of legal actions is the expensive part of assembly sequencing. Any practical algorithm must avoid exploring all but a tiny fraction of the state space.

Measuring problem-solving performance
Before we get into the design of various search algorithms, we will consider the criteria used to choose among them. We can evaluate an algorithm’s performance in four ways:
•
Completeness:
Is the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one, and to correctly report failure when there is not?",前：chap3_para109 | 后：chap3_para111,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"algorithm,performance,measuring",无,,

That goal could be anywhere in the state space; therefore a complete algorithm must be capable of systematically exploring every state that is reachable from the initial state.

s

Whether A* is cost-optimal depends on certain properties of the heuristic. A key property is
admissibility
: an
admissible heuristic
is one that
never overestimates
the cost to reach a goal. (An admissible heuristic is therefore
optimistic.)
With
an admissible heuristic, A* is cost-optimal, which we can show with a proof by contradiction. Suppose the optimal path has cost
C
*, but the algorithm returns a path with cost
C > C
*. Then there must be some node
n
which is on the optimal path and is unexpanded (because if all the nodes on the optimal path had been expanded, then we would have returned that optimal solution). So then, using the notation
g
*(
n
) to mean the cost of the optimal path from the start to
n
, and
h*
(
n
) to mean the cost of the optimal path from
n
to the nearest goal, we have:
f
(
n

C

(otherwise
n
would have been expanded)
f

g

f

search has many good qualities, but it expands a lot of nodes. We can explore fewer nodes (taking less time and space) if we are willing to accept solutions that are suboptimal, but are “good enough”—what we call

nodes expanded. For example, road engineers know the concept of a
detour index,

Learning to search better
We have presented several fixed search strategies—breadth-first, A*, and so on—that have been carefully designed and programmed by computer scientists. Could an agent
learn
how to search better? The answer is yes, and the method rests on an important concept called the
metalevel state space
. Each state in a metalevel state space captures the internal (computational) state of a program that is searching in an ordinary state space such as the map of Romania. (To keep the two concepts separate, we call the map of Romania an
object-level state space
.) For example, the internal state of the A* algorithm consists of the current search tree. Each action in the metalevel state space is a computation step that alters the internal
state; for example, each computation step in A* expands a leaf node and adds its successors to the tree. Thus,
Figure 3.18
, which shows a sequence of larger and larger search trees, can be seen as depicting a path in the metalevel state space where each state on the path is an object-level search tree.",前：chap3_para340 | 后：chap3_para342,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"state,search,space","Romania,Romania",,

Learning heuristics from experience
We have seen that one way to invent a heuristic is to devise a relaxed problem for which an optimal solution can be found easily. An alternative is to learn from experience. “Experience” here means solving lots of 8-puzzles, for instance. Each optimal solution to an 8-puzzle problem provides an example (goal, path) pair. From these examples, a learning algorithm can be used to construct a function
h
that can (with luck) approximate the true path cost for other states that arise during search. Most of these approaches learn an imperfect approximation to the heuristic function, and thus risk inadmissibility. This leads to an inevitable tradeoff between learning time, search run time, and solution cost. Techniques for machine learning are demonstrated in
Chapter 19

In any problem with a cycle of net negative cost, the cost-optimal solution is to go around that cycle an infinite number of times. The Bellman–Ford and Floyd–Warshall algorithms (not covered here) handle negative-cost actions, as long as there are no negative cycles. It is easy to accommodate zero-cost actions, as long as the number of consecutive zero-cost actions is bounded. For example, we might have a robot where there is a cost to move, but zero cost to rotate 90
o
; the algorithms in this chapter can handle this as long as no more than three consecutive 90
o
turns are allowed. There is also a complication with problems that have an infinite number of arbitrarily small action costs. Consider a version of Zeno’s paradox where there is an action to move half way to the goal, at a cost of half of the previous move. This problem has no solution with a finite number of actions, but to prevent a search from taking an unbounded number of actions without quite reaching the goal, we can require that all action costs be at least

If we shake the surface, we can bounce the ball out of the local minimum—perhaps into a deeper local minimum, where it will spend more time. The trick is to shake just hard enough to bounce the ball out of local minima but not hard enough to dislodge it from the global minimum.

How do we find these contingent solutions to nondeterministic problems? As in

Searching with no observation
When the agent’s percepts provide
no information at all,
we have what is called a
sensorless
problem (or a
conformant
problem). At first, you might think the sensorless agent has no hope of solving a problem if it has no idea what state it starts in, but sensorless solutions are surprisingly common and useful, primarily because they
don’t
rely on sensors working properly. In manufacturing systems, for example, many ingenious methods have been developed for orienting parts correctly from an unknown initial position by using a sequence of actions with no sensing at all. Sometimes a sensorless plan is better even when a conditional plan with sensing is available. For example, doctors often prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic rather than using the conditional plan of doing a blood test, then waiting for the results to come back, and then prescribing a more specific antibiotic. The sensorless plan saves time and money, and avoids the risk of the infection worsening before the test results are available.",前：chap4_para112 | 后：chap4_para114,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"sensorless,plan,problem",无,,

Online search agents
After each action, an online agent in an observable environment receives a percept telling it what state it has reached; from this information, it can augment its map of the environment. The updated map is then used to plan where to go next. This interleaving of planning and action means that online search algorithms are quite different from the offline search algorithms we have seen previously: offline algorithms explore their
model
of the state space, while online algorithms explore the real world. For example, A* can expand a node in one part of the space and then immediately expand a node in a distant part of the space, because node expansion involves simulated rather than real actions.",前：chap4_para194 | 后：chap4_para196,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"online,search,action",无,,

In depth-first search, this means going back to the state from which the agent most recently entered the current state.

Local search techniques have a long history in mathematics and computer science. Indeed, the Newton–Raphson method (Newton, 1671; Raphson, 1690) can be seen as a very efficient local search method for continuous spaces in which gradient information is available. Brent (1973) is a classic reference for optimization algorithms that do not require such information. Beam search, which we have presented as a local search algorithm, originated as a bounded-width variant of dynamic programming for speech recognition in the H

The whole job is composed of tasks, and we can model each task as a variable, where the value of each variable is the time that the task starts, expressed as an integer number of minutes. Constraints can assert that one task must occur before another—for example, a wheel must be installed before the hubcap is put on—and that only so many tasks can go on at once. Constraints can also specify that a task takes a certain amount of time to complete.",前：chap5_para23 | 后：chap5_para25,AI_Popular,Semi_Formal_Academic,"task,problem,scheduling",CSP,,

The best-known category of continuous-domain CSPs is that of
linear programming
problems, where constraints must be linear equalities or inequalities. Linear programming problems can be solved in time polynomial in the number of variables.

constraint propagation
: using the constraints to reduce the number of legal values for a variable, which
in turn can reduce the legal values for another variable, and so on. The idea is that this will leave fewer choices to consider when we make the next choice of a variable assignment.

Global constraints
Remember that a
global constraint
is one involving an arbitrary number of variables (but not necessarily all variables). Global constraints occur frequently in real problems and can be handled by special-purpose algorithms that are more efficient than the general-purpose methods described so far. For example, the
Alldiff
constraint says that all the variables involved must have distinct values (as in the cryptarithmetic problem above and Sudoku puzzles below). One simple form of inconsistency detection for
Alldiff
constraints works as follows: if
m
variables are involved in the constraint, and if they have
n
possible distinct values altogether, and
m > n,
then the constraint cannot be satisfied.",前：chap5_para65 | 后：chap5_para67,AI_Popular,Formal_Academic,"constraint,variable,global",Sudoku,,
