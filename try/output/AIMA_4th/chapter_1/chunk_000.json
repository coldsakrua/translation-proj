      "context_meaning": "The term 'Artificial Intelligence' refers to the field of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of intelligent behavior similar to that of humans. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics, aimed at simulating human intelligence in machines.",
      "suggested_trans": "人工智能",
      "rationale": "The suggested translation matches the provided translation memory, which aligns with the standard translation of 'Artificial Intelligence' into Chinese. The context in which 'Artificial Intelligence' is used in the source text indicates a broad field of study and development, therefore, the translation '人工智能' is appropriate as it captures the essence of intelligence that is artificially created, rather than innate or natural."

      "suggested_trans": "斯图尔特·J·拉塞尔",
      "rationale": "The name 'Stuart J. Russell' is a proper noun referring to a person. Translating it into Chinese, we use the standard transliteration method for English names into Chinese. 'Stuart' is transliterated as '斯图尔特', 'J.' is kept as is since it is an initial, and 'Russell' is transliterated as '拉塞尔'. The name is well-known in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and maintaining the transliteration helps to preserve the identity and recognition of the individual."

In the context of the provided source text, he is the co-author of the book 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach' along with Stuart J. Russell.",
      "suggested_trans": "彼得·诺维格",
      "rationale": "The term 'Peter Norvig' is a proper noun representing a specific individual's name. Since it's a personal name, the translation should retain its original form to accurately represent the person. The suggested translation '彼得·诺维格' is a phonetic rendering of the name in Chinese, which is a common practice for translating personal names. The context meaning is provided to ensure that the person's professional background is understood, which is important when translating names of notable individuals."

      "suggested_trans": "Ming-Wei Chang",
      "rationale": "As 'Ming-Wei Chang' is a personal name, it should be retained in its original form to respect the individual's identity and to maintain consistency with the source material. Personal names are generally not translated in academic or professional contexts unless the person has a known preference for a specific translation or transliteration. In this case, no such preference is indicated, and the name appears in the context of a list of contributing authors, so the original name is the most appropriate and respectful representation."

      "suggested_trans": "雅各布·德夫林",
      "rationale": "The term 'Jacob Devlin' is a proper noun referring to an individual's name. Given that it is a personal name, the most appropriate translation approach is to transliterate the name into the target language while preserving its pronunciation and meaning. In this case, the name 'Jacob Devlin' is translated to '雅各布·德夫林' in Chinese, which reflects a phonetic rendering that would be recognizable to speakers of the target language as the same name."
